# EcoPulse

EcoPulse is a lightweight static website that highlights key environmental metrics
and provides actions that visitors can take to make a difference.


## Features

### Dashboard Cards
Four cards show quick facts about climate, forest loss, ocean plastic pollution,
and local air quality. The climate and forests sections embed interactive maps
from thirdâ€‘party sources. The oceans card displays a static infographic, while
the air quality card fetches live data from the AirNow API and shows a heatmap of
pollution by ZIP code.

### Hero Video
A looping video plays in the background of the hero section to set the tone of
the site. A prominent "Start Tracking" button jumps directly to the dashboard
cards.

### Take Action
Below the data widgets, visitors can find lifestyle tips, volunteer links, and
trusted organizations for donations. These pointers aim to encourage tangible
changes beyond simply viewing data.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes or feature improvements. Please include
clear descriptions and, when relevant, code comments explaining the intent of
